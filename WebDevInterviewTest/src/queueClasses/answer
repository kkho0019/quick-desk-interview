b.  If youâ€™ve written your enqueue and dequeue using array methods, how would you
    rewrite the same functions without using any array methods?
    - no array methods used in both enqueue and dequeue.

c.  Show how you would improve the design of your classes, apply various design
    patterns and techniques as you see fit
    - Create abstract class for FIFOQUEUE and LIFOQUEUE (e.g. QUEUE) since enqueue
      and dequeue are the only methods with different implementations in the two
      classes. Only parent class will implement the interface, thus reducing the
      dependency between classes and interface.
